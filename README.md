# Castmate

A WiFi enabled physical volume knob for Chromecasts via a mash up of Griffin's no longer made USB device the 
[PowerMate](https://support.griffintechnology.com/product/powermate/) and
the awesome python Chromecast controlling library [catt](https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt/)
using the equally awesome [powermate-linux](https://github.com/stefansundin/powermate-linux)
 app.

## Current

Currently this is just my testing area as I build out a functional prototype.
